## Description
   It's a single-page application uses React, [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial). It provides information about my favorite cafe with the Best Coffee in Dublin. For more information about place uses [Yelp.API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3) (ex: address, phone, rating and openingÂ hours).

### Backend:
  Yelp.API doesn't support CORS. I added small proxy backend written in python ([yelpapi-python](https://github.com/gfairchild/yelpapi)). It allows CORS and proxies Yelp API methods I need.

### Responsive:
  The application is usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers and looks good at the different screen sizes. For Icons uses: [Font Awesome](https://www.w3schools.com/icons/fontawesome_icons_intro.asp)

### Accessibility:
  The application supporting Web Accessibility features. You can navigate through app by using keyboard.

### Offline Use:
  The application is available even without a connection. Uses [Service Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/).
